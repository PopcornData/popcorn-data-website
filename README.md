## About
PopcornData is a website made to analyse movie trends in Singapore — from which seats people prefer to the way they like to watch different movies. 
The required data was scraped from the website of Shaw Theatres, one of the biggest cinema chains in Singapore, using a webscraper we built with Python and Selenium ([shaw-scraper](https://github.com/PopcornData/shaw-scraper))

The data scraped was for January 2020 and using it we were able to build interesting visualisations about how people watched different movies, at different halls, theatres and timings! 

Some unique visualisations include:

* **Heat maps** to show the most popular seats

* **Animations** to show the order in which seats were bought
